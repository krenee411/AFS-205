    <h1 id="C1">Rougarou</h1>
    <h3 id="C2">You are walking down a dark road in sotheren Louisiana. The only light you see is from the full moon hanging high in the sky. You hear a noise off to your side, you stop and peer into the dark, scanning. Your gaze falls on a giant set of glowing red eyes! Before you can process what you are seeing,
    a large man like figure lunges towards you. As the figure moves into the light you can see a wolf like face and a body coved in patches of fur. You now find yourself in the clutches of a Rougarou. What is a Rougarou you may ask, well we have to take a trip down the bayou all the way to Louisiana.
    Louisiana is a mix of French backgrounds, that is where the term loup-garou came from. Loup mening wolf and garou meaning wearwolf. The term Rougarou we are using here is just a variant of the pronunciation. This tale comes from the Cathlic Chruch, to inspire obedience during Lent.
    It was said that if you were to break Lent for seven years in a row a witch would tur you into a loup-garou.It was later used as a cautionary tale for young children to make them listen to their parent, because if not the Rougarou would take you away. The most common places to see or run into this beast
    insugar cane fields, swamps, and woodland areas, which incase you didnt know is everywhere in Louisiana. Now lets talk about the curse itself, it is said to only last 101 days, but only if you can keep it a secret, if you tell someone you will be a Rougarou forever. There are several ways to pass the cures onto another, 
    to while in Rougarou form someone has to cut you deep enough to draw blood, you will then return to your human form, but before you run away you must tell the one that wounded you your name, now your life as a Rougarou is finished because you passed the curse to another. If you look a Rougarou in the eyes the 
    eyes, the eyes are the window to the soul, so it is thought that the curse can be passed this way too. Now there has to be a way to stop this creature right. Well there is but it is not in the way you may be thinking. The best way to deture this beast is to place 13 items like pennies at your door step,
    the Rougarou can not count past 12, not sure why, but its said to keep it so confused it can not pass. You can even put a rice colander infront of your door and the Rougarou will stay there all night tring to count all the wholes, since it cant get past 12 it will saty until day break then it will return
    back to the woods. Crazy right this giant man wolf can take lives but can not count to 13. If you are from the south you know and fear this monster. This being said in Houma every year we do celebrate this legand, its called Rougarou Fest where people can dress up and eat good sotheren cajun cooking. 
    So if you ever found yourself in South Louisiana keep an eye out and always keep 13 pennies in your pocket and hope you dont run in our local legand the Rougarou!!!
