    <h1 id="M">Jeffery Dahmer</h1>
    <h2 id="M2">Trigger Warning: this case contains violance and rape</h2>
    <h3 id="M3">
    This is a pretty gnarley case so buckle up! We are going to talk about the Milwaukee cannibal. He was born on May 21, 1960, his name Jeffrey Dahmer. His was born to Lionel and Joyce Dahmer, his dad was a research chemist
    meaning he wasnt really around all that much when Jeff was growning up. His mom was a Teletype machine instructor (I didnt know what that was at first but it was like a telegraph/typewriter/early computers made to send messages)
    So his struggled with depression and maybe some other mental conditions, she was a bit of a hypercondriac, at one point she did attempt suicide by overdosing on pills. Now on most accounts Jeff was described as an energetic and happy kid.
    So everything was peachy until he turned 4, he was diagnosed with a double hernia. So this of course this had to be corrected, but no one really explained this surgey to Jeff, they kind of just brought him to the hospital and said 
    your having surgery! So being a 4 year old im sure that was super scary and traumatizing. So after this he was no longer the happy ahild he was before. He was very withdrawn and would sit for hours and not say a word. Then the Dahmer's 
    welcomed a new baby into the world his name was David. So Joyce with a new baby and struggling with her mental health did not leave much time for Jeffrey, the poor baby probably felt neglected, but his life goes on. As he got older Jeff 
    showed a real intrest in bones. His dad being a research chemist was like cool we can bond over this. At dinner Jeff asked his dad what would happen if I put chicken bones in bleach?<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more1">Lionel was like you know what lets do an experiment.
    So being a super cool dad he showed Jeff the process of bleach bones and what happens when you do it. At this young age his classmates said that he would show up to school drunk, he would even have a flask in his locker. His classmates would discribe him as a loner but also a class clown. 
    He would even sneak into club yearbook photos at he wasnt even a part of. Fast forward again, Jeff is in high school, his fantasies of domination and rape are on full blast. When he thought about sex he didnt want his partner to move.
    He also realised that he was gay. Which in the 60s was not allowed! Now around this time Jeff took notice of a male jogger that would run down the road near his house, Jeff thought he was attractive. This jogger became the subject of Jeffs rape fantasies.
    Before long the fantasies werent enought so Jeff decided to get a baseball bat and hide in the bushes near the joggers path, he was going to knock the guy out and live out his sick dream. But just so happens the jogger didnt go for a run on this day, which
    really saved his life! Moving on in 1978 Dahmers parents finally got divorced after years of an on the rocks marriage. Durring this time David the younger brother went to live with Joyce, and Jeff stayed with Lionel.
    Now Jeffs dad had a girlfried and they lived together at her house, meaning that Jeff was pretty much left alone...abandoned in this house. A 17 year old boy alone in a house what could go wrong right? In this house alone is where Jeff commited his first murder!
    He is now 18 and his fantasies have evolved again, now he dreams of picking up a hitch-hicker raping and murdering him. So what did Jeff do, he was driving down the road and saw a young man walking. This unlucky young man is Steven Mark Hicks, he was 18 years old
    and on his way to a rock concert. Somehow Jeff was able to convence Steven to come back to his house, where they drank beer and hung out even had consensual sex. Then Steven told Jeffrey that he wanted to leave, that didnt fly with Jeff. So what did he do you ask,
    well he hit him over the head with a dumbbell, then strangled him. But the crazy doesnt stop there he then stripped Steven and masterbated over his dead body and went to bed. In the morning he decided to dissect the body, he cut this poor boy into pieces and burried
    in the back yard. In fear of being cought two weeks later he dug up the body, stripped his skin off and fluched the it down the toilet, then boiled the bones in acid, crushed them with a hammer and spread the dust in the woods. See his dads teaching come back to him 
    in a bad way!! After all this Jeff went to collage and carried on with his "normal" life. Well that was until he flunked out of hos first simester! Lionel was like yo Jeff you need to do something with your life so he joined the army! That straightened him out right...
    no. no it did not. A fellow soldier come forward years later and said that Dahmer repeatedly raped him over a 17 month pierod. In 1981 Jeff was formily discharged from service due to alcoholism. He was to scared to go home and tell his dad what happened so he did the 
    next most logical thing and moved to Miami, and got a job at a sandwich shop. That didnt last long with the drinking and all. Eventually he went back to Ohio and moved in with his dad and now new wife. Lionel's wife hated Jeff and his continuous drinking, so beofre long 
    they sent him off to live with his grandmother in Wisconsin. Things didnt get better! In 1982 Jeff was arrested for indecent exposure. He was arrested again in 1986 when two boys accused him of masturbating in front of them, he got 1 year probation. Moving forward Jeff
    need money for booze so he got a job at a chocolate factory. At this time Jeff would frequent gay bars and bath houses you know living his best life. Just kidding his messed up fantasies were back again and he would look at the men around him and think humm i want to sleep 
    with these guys...oh yea and I want them to be dead when I do it. So to make his dreams come true he would drug his partners and rape them. Some time later in 1987 Jeffrey picked up his next victum at a bar, his name was Steven Tuomi he was 25 years old. Jeff brought him
    back to a hotel room he was renting, where he planned to drug and rape him, and he did. But the next morning Jeff woke up to beaten and dead Steven and his own knuckles were brused and bloody. Later Jeff would say that he was so black out drunk he didnt remember commiting
    this crime. So now he has to get rid of the body so he went and got 2 large suitcases then brought them home to his gradmothers house. He ended up keeping the body for a few days before he dismembered and disposed of it, well not all of it he kept Stevens head. He kept his head 
    for about 2 weeks before he boiled and bleached it so he could keep it to masterbate to. But to Dahmers dismay the skull was to brittle and he had to smash it up and get rid of it. Dahmer went on to kill 2 more people. Then in 1989 Jeff lured  Anthony Sears to his grandmothers 
    basment where he drugged, strangled, sodomized, photographed, and dismembered him. For a few years Dahmer laid low, but that didnt last long his body count went from 5 to 17. Lets fast forward to when Dahmer go cought. A 32-year-old African American man, Tracy Edwards was 
    found wandering the streets with handcuffs dangling from his wrist. Police were called and when they arrived Tracy told them some dude had drugged him, tried to restrain him, and threatened him with a knife. The cops brought Tracy back to Dahmers appartment to get the keys 
    to the handcuffs. After arriving Tracy said that the knife that Jeff used to threaten him was in the bedroom. So police decided to take a look, thats when they made a grizzly discovery, polaroid pictures of dismembered bodies lying around. Thats when cops finally got it right
    and arrested him! Upon going back to Jeffs appartment they found a head in the refrigerator, three more in the freezer and a catalog of other horrors, including preserved skulls, jars containing genitalia and an extensive gallery of his victims. Now we get to Jeffrey's trial,
    in 1992 this is were the details of Jeffery's crimes come to light. How he brutalized his victumes, ate them, and cook their skulls and keep them as souvenirs. He was sentenced to 16 consecutive life terms in prison. Jeff did last for to long in prision,
    he was brutally beaten to death in 1994, by a fellow inmate Christopher Scarver.   <br>
